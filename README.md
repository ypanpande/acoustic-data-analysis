# AES data result display

A tool to visualize the processed and analysied acoustic emission signals in a variety of fields.

## Overview

This software is used to display the processed and analysied acoustic emission signals, which is stored in a database .h5. Fields such as time range, the method of localization, location range, channel info and etc. should be setted at first. The results can be showed in a variety of forms such as heatmap, histgram in the fields location, time, frequency for analysis.
